    "## Step 3: How SACEF Intelligently Finds the Vulnerability\n\n",
    "This is where SACEF's advanced features shine. A simple random fuzzer would have a very low chance of discovering this specific vulnerability. SACEF is different:\n\n",
    "1.  **ML Prediction**: The `MLVulnerabilityPredictor` analyzes the `is_blocked` function. It sees the code complexity from the `if` statement and suggests a `'logic_bypass'` strategy to the fuzzer.\n",
    "2.  **Concolic Execution**: The `SymbolicPathExplorer` is the key. It traces the code with a valid input like `\"http://evil.com\"`. It sees the condition `if parsed_url.hostname == blocked_domain:` and understands that to explore the *other path* (where the check returns `False`), it needs to find an input where `parsed_url.hostname` is *not* equal to `\"evil.com\"`. The Z3 solver can easily find a model for this, and one of the simplest solutions it can generate is by altering the input string slightly, for example, by adding a leading space: `\" http://evil.com\"`.\n",
    "3.  **Guided Fuzzing**: This new, intelligently-generated input is added to the `GeneticFuzzer`'s population. The fuzzer then runs, confirms that this input is a vulnerability, and reports it."

    "## Step 4: Running SACEF\n\n",

This wrapper will call our `is_blocked` function and raise a custom `BypassFound` exception if the security check is bypassed. SACEF will then find the input that causes this exception."
